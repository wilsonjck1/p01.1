"""
Problem:

    A desperate gambler has bet all of his money on a final last throw of the die.
    If he rolls a six, he survives to fight another day.
    Anything else, and he gets thrown to the thugs waiting for him in the back alley.

    The gone_bust function takes an integer n, and should print either "Pheww!" or
    "HELP! HELP!" depending on whether he survives or not.

Tests:

    >>> gone_bust(2)
    HELP! HELP!
    >>> gone_bust(6)
    Pheww!
    >>> gone_bust(10)
    HELP! HELP!
